# I_LOVE_YOU-virus
Below is the text of the pathetic LoveLetter "virus", for anyone who's interested. It has been reformatted as an plain text/HTML file, so there's no need to worry about being infected by it. For God's sake, don't copy the text into a .VBS file and run it, espescially if you have installed any new MSIE (this little bugger will wipe out your MP3s!!)
